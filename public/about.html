<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a Web Developer with a deep appreciation for clean code, intuitive design, and purposeful functionality. I specialize in creating responsive websites and dynamic web applications that not only look great but perform seamlessly across devices. With experience in both front-end and back-end development, I enjoy solving problems, learning new technologies, and building meaningful digital solutions.</p>

But there's more to me than just lines of code.

<p>I'm also a passionate musician. Music has always been a creative outlet for me—whether I'm composing, playing instruments, or just jamming with friends. It keeps me grounded and reminds me of the importance of rhythm and flow, both of which I carry into my work as a developer.</p>

<p>When I’m not immersed in web projects or music, I’m most likely outdoors. I’m a nature lover who finds inspiration and peace in the wild—whether it’s hiking, camping, or simply taking a walk among the trees. Nature reminds me to slow down, breathe, and appreciate the beauty in simplicity.

<p>I strive to bring that same balance, creativity, and thoughtfulness to everything I do—blending logic with artistry, structure with freedom, and technology with human connection.</p>
